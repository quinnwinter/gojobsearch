This program is a webscraper built in Go that will search job sites, and return the results based on certain user inputs and keywords.

To run the program from the command line:

> $ go run job_scraper.go

You will then be prompted to enter a series of parameters for the job search.

After the parameters have been entered, it will begin to search different job sites based on the input parameters.

Once complete, output.txt will hold all of the jobs that are a match for the particular search, with the highest matching jobs at the top based on the keywords.
